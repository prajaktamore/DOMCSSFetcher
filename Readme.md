A configurable web GUI tool to help users generate/understand DOM element selectors. See the example page

Reference from Caplin Super Selector.
Tester usually write test cases based on CSS Selectors. We use firebug extension firefinder to locate elements using CSS selectors.
The existing SuperSelector tool selects only one element at a time.
But the new enhancement DOMCSSFetcher will help to retrieve all elements within a specific elements.
This will help testers to directly retrieve elements at once time in a specific div or form or other group element.
Also have added a extension to customize the elements with specific tag are excluded according to user requirement.
